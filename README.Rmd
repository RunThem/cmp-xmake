# Introduction

nvim-cmp-fonts is a completion source for
[nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) that provides sources for fonts.
This is especially useful for editing
[configuration](#only-for-certain-file-types) file types. It gets them from the
fonts installed on your computer, which you can see by using the `fc-list`
command. Every time you open Neovim, the list of fonts is updated.
